Once you have properly set up Git/GitHub, you can download the repositories you need.

NOTE: Execute all commands here under your username, NOT root.

1.  If you haven't already done so, enter the command "mkdir ~/doppler".
2.  Enter the command "cd ~/doppler" and then "git clone git@github.com:dopplervalueinvesting/intro.git".
3.  Enter "cd ~/intro" and then "sh download.sh"

Now all of the repositories you need are in the ~/doppler directory.
The "input" directory contains the input data.
The "output" directory contains the output data saved to the GitHub repository.
The "calc" directory contains the Python script that processes the data.
The "temp-output" directory contains the output files generated by the Python script.
